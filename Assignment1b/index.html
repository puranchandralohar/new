                    <p>Wanda Maximoff (also known as Scarlet Witch) is a Marvel Comics
                        character who has appeared in many Marvel-related productions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, she first appears as a cameo in
                        the mid-credits scene of 2014's film Captain America: The Winter Soldier,
                        and becomes a more prominent character after returning in 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron.
                        She and Vision are the titular protagonists of the Disney+ series WandaVision.
                    </p>

                    <p>Wanda is the twin sister of Pietro Maximoff, alias Quicksilver.
                        She started out as a vengeful lackey to the evil Ultron, before redeeming herself
                        and joining the Avengers following the death of her brother, who would have done likewise if he
                        had lived.
                    </p>

                    <p>Scarlet Witch was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.</p>
